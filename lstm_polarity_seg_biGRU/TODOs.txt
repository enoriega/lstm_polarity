1, use inputVector and inputTensor
Using inputVector seems to be totally the same as using inputTensor. The input expression is also the same as the embedding lookup method. 
What other things we need to do to check the function of inputVector
2, understand initial state and renew_cg
3, make sure the attention mechanism is correctly implemented
4, test renew_cg
5, for bi gru, see this github repo:
